Ground Radiation Monitoring QGIS Plugin's Documentation
=======================================================

This plugin computes the gamma radiation dose of a given route 
on an interpolated map of dose rate values. The secondary product
of the plugin are basic statistics about the given route. Together,
these output values help the emergency teams to determine which 
route will be the best and safest for mobile radiation monitoring
teams for radiation monitoring during nuclear disaster emergency 
exercises (or during the nuclear disaster itself).

The plugin was created for National Radiation Protection Institute
(`SURO <http://www.suro.cz>`__).
